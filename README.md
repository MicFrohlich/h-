### Technical Demo Setup H+ README

## Task Description

Using python build a server with services to pull the profile and the appointments data from a DB. For this MVP, you can pull the data from a JSON mock file, as the actual access to the database will be implemented in future sprints.
Mandatory: Unit test, SOLID and a clean code approach

# Thoughts

Creating the mock data requires some thought as to DB design

What am i exactly supposed to do here? Right a JSON file then just make a set of tools to read from them
